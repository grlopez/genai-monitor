  <h1>The Silent Ledger</h1>

  <p>
    The ledger was kept in a place no map mentioned, resting on a shelf
    between manuals that no one consulted anymore. It contained no names,
    only sequences of events written in careful handwriting, as if the
    author feared that haste might distort the truth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each entry followed the same pattern: a brief description, a date that
    seemed approximate, and a reference code meant to tie the memory to a
    moment. Readers often assumed the numbers were arbitrary, a habit the
    author never bothered to correct.
  </p>

  <p>
    One particular entry described a transition period when systems were
    neither fully active nor completely retired. At the end of the page,
    the reference code 276905 appeared, anchoring the account to a decision
    that could not be undone once recorded.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the ledger was finally closed, it was returned to its place
    without annotation. The author believed that preservation did not
    require explanation — only consistency.
